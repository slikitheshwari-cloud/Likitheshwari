A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions:

(i) Hardness must be greater than 50

(ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7
iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600

The grades are as follows:

Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met

Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met

Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met

Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met

Grade is 6 if only one condition is met

Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met

Write a program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.


solution:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int h,c,t;
printf("\n enter hardness");
scanf("%d",&h);
printf("\n enter carbon content");
scanf("%d",&c);
printf("\n enter tensile strength");
scanf("%d",&t);
if(h>50&&c<0.7&&t>5600)
printf("\n grade is 10");
else if(h>50&&c<0.7)
printf("\n grade is 9");
else if(c<0.7&&t>5600)
printf("\n grade is 8");
else if(h>50&&t>5600)
printf("\n grade is 7");
else if(h>50||c<0.7||t>5600)
printf("\n grade is 6");
else
printf("\n grade is 5");
}
